# Feature Debugging: $ARGUMENTS

Debug and resolve the following issue in Gmail TUI using systematic analysis and architectural compliance.

## Issue Details
**Problem Description:** $ARGUMENTS

## MANDATORY Debugging Process

### 1. Issue Analysis & Categorization
- **Analyze the problem description** thoroughly
- **Identify affected components** (UI, services, integrations)
- **Categorize issue type** (crash, hang, incorrect behavior, performance, UI)
- **Assess severity and user impact**
- **Reproduce the issue** if possible with available information
- **Check recent changes** that might have introduced the issue

### 2. Log Analysis (Primary Debugging Tool)
- **Examine `a.logger` output** for the affected operations
- **Look for error patterns** and execution flow
- **Trace service method calls** and their parameters
- **Check UI state changes** logged during issue occurrence  
- **Identify timing patterns** or race conditions in logs
- **Missing logs** often indicate where problems occur

### 3. Code Investigation
- **Examine relevant source files** based on issue description
- **Trace execution paths** through the codebase
- **Check for architectural violations**:
  - Business logic in UI components
  - Direct field access instead of accessors
  - Missing error handling with ErrorHandler
  - `QueueUpdateDraw()` in ESC handlers or streaming callbacks
- **Review recent changes** in Git history
- **Look for thread safety issues**

### 4. Common Issue Patterns

#### **Application Hanging/Deadlock**
- Check for `QueueUpdateDraw()` in ESC handlers (most common cause)
- Look for `QueueUpdateDraw()` in streaming callbacks (AI features)
- Examine goroutine synchronization and channel blocking
- Check for circular dependencies in UI updates
- Review mutex usage and potential deadlocks

#### **Feature Not Working**
- Verify service initialization in `initServices()`
- Check service method implementations and error handling
- Test keyboard shortcut and command parity
- Examine UI integration patterns and focus management
- Validate bulk mode support

#### **Performance Issues**  
- Profile memory usage and identify leaks
- Check for inefficient algorithms or unnecessary API calls
- Examine caching strategies and database queries
- Look for blocking operations on UI thread
- Review streaming and async operation patterns

#### **UI Display Issues**
- Check theme integration and color usage
- Validate screen width calculations and text formatting
- Test with different terminal sizes and themes
- Verify focus management and Tab cycling
- Examine picker/modal integration

#### **Labels/Picker Issues**
- Check side panel picker architecture compliance
- Verify focus restoration patterns
- Test filter-to-single-result behavior
- Examine cache management for operations
- Check bulk operation support

#### **External Integration Problems**
- Test service availability and error handling
- Check configuration-driven integration flags
- Verify graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Examine authentication and API integration
- Test timeout and retry mechanisms

### 5. Root Cause Analysis
- **Distinguish symptoms from actual causes**
- **Identify the underlying issue** (not just visible problem)
- **Assess if it's a regression** or existing bug
- **Determine scope of impact** (single feature vs system-wide)
- **Consider architectural implications**

### 6. Fix Strategy Development
- **Design targeted fixes** that address root cause
- **Consider side effects** and potential regressions
- **Plan testing approach** to verify fix
- **Assess if architectural changes** are needed
- **Follow established patterns** from AGENTS.md

### 7. Implementation & Testing
- **Apply fixes following architectural requirements**:
  - Maintain service-first architecture
  - Use ErrorHandler for all user feedback
  - Ensure thread safety with accessor methods
  - Proper ESC key handling
  - Comprehensive logging of changes
- **Add safeguards** to prevent similar issues
- **Use testing framework for verification**:
  - Write unit tests for service fixes using mock dependencies
  - Create component tests with test harness and SimulationScreen  
  - Add integration tests for end-to-end workflow validation
  - Use visual regression tests to catch UI inconsistencies
  - Test async operations and goroutine management
  - Validate bulk operation behavior
  - Test keyboard shortcut functionality
- **Test thoroughly** including edge cases and bulk operations
- **Verify no regressions** in related functionality

## Debugging Toolkit

### **Log Analysis Patterns**
```bash
# Filter logs for specific operations
grep "serviceName:" app.log | grep "operation"

# Check for error patterns
grep "error\|failed\|Error" app.log

# Trace specific user actions
grep "focusManager\|keyHandler" app.log
```

### **Testing Framework for Debugging**
```bash
# Run relevant tests to reproduce and verify fixes
make test-unit          # Test service logic in isolation
make test-tui           # Test TUI components with simulation
make test-integration   # Test end-to-end workflows
make test-all          # Run comprehensive test suite

# Test specific components during debugging
go test ./test/helpers -run TestBulkOperations    # Bulk operation issues
go test ./test/helpers -run TestKeyboardShortcuts # Keyboard shortcut problems
go test ./test/helpers -run TestAsyncOperations   # Async/goroutine issues
go test ./test/helpers -run TestVisualRegression  # UI display problems
```

### **Test Harness for Issue Reproduction**
Use the test harness to reproduce issues in isolation:
```go
// Create isolated test environment
harness := helpers.NewTestHarness(t)
defer harness.Cleanup()

// Simulate problematic user interactions
harness.SimulateKeyEvent(tcell.KeyEscape, 0, tcell.ModNone)
harness.SimulateTyping("problematic input")

// Capture screen state for analysis
content := harness.GetScreenContent()
assert.Contains(t, content, "expected behavior")
```
