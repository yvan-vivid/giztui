# Changelog

All notable changes to GizTUI (formerly Gmail TUI) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.19.1] - 2026-06-28

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed a latent crash in bulk selection.** The set of bulk-selected messages was an unsynchronized map read from background operation goroutines (bulk archive/label/prompt/Slack/Obsidian) while being modified on the event loop — a concurrent-map access that could panic under the right timing. It is now behind a small mutex-guarded type, eliminating the race.

### 🔧 Internal

- **God-object decomposition (#49) wrapped up.** Extracted `bulkState` and `focusState` from the 3,400-line `App` struct and removed dead/orphan fields; `App` is down from 129 to 89 fields. Notably, the focus name (e.g. `"labels"`) used to be written twice at ~95 call sites (`currentFocus = name` + `updateFocusIndicators(name)`) — a drift footgun now collapsed into a single `markFocus(name)` helper. No user-visible behavior change. The remaining loose field groups were analyzed and consciously left as-is (see #52).

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-24

### 🚀 Features

- **Tab autocompletion in the `:` command bar.** Pressing Tab now cycles through the commands that match what you've typed (Shift+Tab goes back, Enter runs whichever is shown); a single match completes fully. After a command + space, Tab completes its arguments where it applies, honoring each command's real grammar:
  - subcommands — `:labels add/list/remove`, `:prompt list/create/update/export/delete/stats`, `:theme list/preview/set`, `:accounts switch`;
  - then names where a name is expected — label names (`:labels add <name>`), theme names (`:theme set <name>`), account ids (`:accounts switch <id>`), saved-query names (`:bookmark <name>`);
  - Gmail search operators after `:search` (`from:`, `has:attachment`, `is:unread`…).
  Completion is driven by a single command registry (replacing the old hand-maintained prefix map), so every command autocompletes and stays in sync. A greyed inline hint shows the first candidate as you type.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-22

### 🐛 Fixes

- **AI summary streaming no longer risks freezing on ESC.** The single-message summary (`y`) and thread summary (`Shift+T` / `:thread-summary`) updated the view via `QueueUpdateDraw` inside their streaming callbacks, which the project's own rules forbid because it can deadlock with the ESC handler. They now update the view directly (guarded by the request context), matching the other AI streaming paths. Pressing ESC mid-stream cancels cleanly and the app stays responsive.
- **`:expand-all` / `:collapse-all` now work on every thread.** They previously did nothing for threads you had never individually expanded/collapsed (a blanket `UPDATE` only touched threads that already had a saved state row). They now affect all currently-displayed threads.
- **Fixed three latent concurrent-map crashes.** The calendar-invite cache, the AI in-flight tracker, and the message cache used during Slack bulk-forward were read/written from multiple goroutines without synchronization. Consolidated behind a single guarded cache type.
- **Fixed latent data races** on the UI-ready / welcome-animation flags, draft-mode reads, and the AI streaming-cancel function (ESC could observe a cancel func a goroutine was clearing).

### 🔧 Changes

- **Cleaner startup — no more spurious key-conflict warnings.** The startup check no longer cries wolf over keys intentionally shared across separate screens (e.g. `a` = archive in the list vs add-rule in the Action Plan). A genuinely new same-context collision is still reported.
- **Threading keys `T` / `E` are unbound by default.** They were eclipsed by quick-search-to (`T`) and reply-all (`E`) in the global key handler and never actually toggled threading. Use the `:threads` / `:flatten` / `:expand-all` commands, or bind a free key in your config. Help screen and `docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` updated.
- **`giztui --migrate-config`** (and `:config migrate`) brings an older `config.json` up to date with newly added defaults.

### 🔧 Internal

- **God-object decomposition (#49) continued, scorecard-driven.** Extracted `overlayBackup`, `draftState`, `uiLifecycle`, `layoutState`, `appCaches`, and `aiPanelState` out of the 3,400-line `App` struct — each a small, unit-tested type — fixing the latent races above along the way. Prioritized with an explicit decision scorecard (`docs/superpowers/REFACTOR-SCORECARD.md`).

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-21

### 🚀 Features — Action Plan & faithful labels

- **Action Plan: Enter opens the email in the reader.** Pressing Enter (or →) on an email node in the Inbox Action Plan selects it in the message list and loads its body into the reader, then moves focus there so you can scroll and read immediately. An email that was archived/moved out of the list still loads by id. Category nodes keep their expand/collapse behavior; Space/`m`/`i` are unchanged. (#51)
- **Faithful labels: the analyzer no longer invents or duplicates labels.** With `inbox_analyzer.strict_labels` (new, default `true`), the analyzer's `label` action may only use a label you already have (matched ignoring case/whitespace). An email whose suggested label matches none of yours goes to "review manually" instead of creating a new/duplicate label — a real help with weak local models. Set it to `false` for the old create-on-miss behavior; if you have no labels at all, enforcement is skipped. The existing-labels prompt instruction is now imperative ("use ONLY a label from this exact list").
- **Action Plan label rows show the actual label.** A label group now reads `Label → <your label> · n/n · PRIORITY` — the real label that will be applied, dropping the redundant model-invented group name (kept for non-label actions like Archive, where it describes what's affected).

### 🔧 Internal

- **God-object refactor pilot (#49):** extracted the VIM key-sequence state out of the 3,400-line `App` struct into a self-contained, mutex-protected `vimState` type with unit tests, fixing a latent locking inconsistency (the event loop wrote the fields without a lock while a timeout goroutine used `App.mu`). No change to VIM behavior (`gg`/`G`/`s5s`/single-op-after-timeout).

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-19

### 🚀 Features — Slack new-mail summaries

- **Per-email AI summary in the auto-refresh Slack notification.** When auto-refresh detects new mail and `auto_refresh.notify_slack` is on, the notification can now include a short AI-generated summary of each new email, rendered as a Slack blockquote under its row. Opt-in via `auto_refresh.slack_summary` (default `false`, because it adds an LLM call per email).
- **Configurable cap.** `auto_refresh.slack_summary_limit` (default `5`) bounds how many emails are summarized per refresh cycle; the rest appear without a summary. Values ≤ 0 are treated as 5.
- **Digest-specific prompt.** `auto_refresh.slack_summary_prompt` overrides the summary prompt; the tuned default produces one factual sentence with no URLs, signatures, or automation/sender boilerplate. Supports `{{body}}` and `{{max_words}}`.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`GMAIL_TUI_CREDENTIALS` is now honored.** The environment variable was advertised but ignored when resolving the credentials path; it now takes effect (CLI flag → env var → config → default).
- Slack summaries render as blockquotes instead of `_italic_`, which previously showed literal underscores when the text contained `@mentions`, `#refs`, or URLs.

### 🔧 Internal

- Dead-code sweep (removed unused package/manager/helpers) and extraction of narrow Gmail-client interfaces (`GmailClient`, `LabelClient`, `LinkClient`, `SlackGmailClient`) so the email/label/link/slack services are unit-testable with mocks. Expanded test coverage across services, render, llm, and obsidian.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-14

### 🚀 Features — Text-to-speech on macOS, multilingual

- **Zero-setup TTS on macOS**: a new `say` engine uses the built-in macOS `say` command — no Piper binary, no voice model, no dependencies. The engine **auto-detects the OS** (`tts.engine: "auto"`, the default): macOS → `say`, other platforms → Piper. Just bind `keys.speak`.
- **Reads each email in its own language**: GizTUI auto-detects the text's language and picks a matching voice, so English mail is read by an English voice and Spanish by a Spanish voice. Configure per-language voices with `tts.voices` (say) or `tts.models` (Piper), e.g. `"voices": {"en":"Samantha","es":"Mónica"}`. Detection is restricted to the languages you configure, which keeps it accurate even on short emails.
- **Streaming playback for `say`**: it starts speaking almost immediately (no synthesize-the-whole-thing-first delay) and stops instantly when you press the speak key again.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Pressing the speak key to **stop** no longer surfaces a spurious "TTS failed" error — a user-requested stop is treated as a clean stop.

See **[docs/TTS.md](docs/TTS.md)** for setup (the macOS quick-start needs nothing installed).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-14

### 🚀 Features / Fixes — focus cycling

- **Tab now cycles through all visible panes, including the message reader.** Previously Tab effectively toggled only list ↔ side picker and skipped the reader (the focus ring matched panes by the focused widget's pointer identity, which never matched a picker's inner input). Cycling is now keyed by pane name, so the order is deterministic: **list → reader → picker / Action Plan → AI summary → Slack** (only the panes currently visible).
- **The Action Plan panel is now part of the cycle too.** Before, Tab with the Action Plan open only toggled panel ↔ list and never reached the reader; now `list → reader → Action Plan` cycle fully (the panel keeps analyzing while focus is elsewhere).
- **`Shift+Tab` cycles focus in reverse** through the same ring.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Action Plan no longer drops selected emails.** When the analyzer model returned only a subset of the analyzed messages (omitting the rest from both categories and `read_manually`), those emails silently vanished from the plan. Any message not placed in a category is now reconciled into **Read manually**, so every selected/analyzed email always appears.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-14

Consolidating round from the v1.7.0→v1.12.0 end-to-end test pass.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Thread summary key conflict**: `thread_summary` defaulted to `shift+t`, which is the same physical key as `toggle_threading` (`T`) and was always shadowed. It is now **unbound by default** — use the `:thread-summary` command, or bind a free key via `keys.thread_summary`.
- **Thread-summary panel rendered in a sliver**: the AI Summary panel was only shown *after* generation, so streamed text wrapped into a ~4-character column and opened without focus. The panel is now opened, sized, and focused **before** generating, matching the single-message summary (`y`).
- **Action Plan footer hints ignored your config**: the panel footer advertised hardcoded keys (e.g. "v prompt") instead of your actual bindings. Hints now reflect `keys.view_prompt`, `keys.remember_rule`, `keys.move`, and `keys.bulk_select`.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Better analyzer prompt structure**: the analyzer prompt now leads with the assistant role + rules + output format, and injects the existing-labels and user-interests **context right before the messages** (previously those blocks were prepended on top, burying the role). Key matching also now understands `shift+<letter>` combos.
- **Slack new-mail notifications are clickable**: each email in the auto-refresh Slack notification is now a hyperlink that opens the message directly in Gmail.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-13

### 🚀 Features — fully configurable key bindings

- **Every action key can now be rebound.** Keys that were previously hardwired to their defaults now honor `keys.*` config: thread summary, undo, the search-box mode toggle and advanced-search keys, prompt preview, the Action Plan remember-rule / view-prompt / move / exclude keys, the analyzer-rules add/delete keys, saved-query delete, attachment save, link copy, and compose send.
- **New `keys.*` options**: `search_toggle_mode` (default `ctrl+t`), `search_advanced` (`ctrl+f`), `prompt_preview` (`ctrl+p`), `remember_rule` (`ctrl+r`), `view_prompt` (`i`), `rule_add` (`a`), `rule_delete` (`d`), `saved_query_delete` (`d`), `attachment_save` (`ctrl+s`), `link_copy` (`ctrl+y`), `compose_send` (`ctrl+j`). They work immediately (defaults are applied at load); run `:config migrate` to also write them into an existing `config.json` for editing.
- Key matching now understands `shift+<letter>` combos (e.g. `shift+t`) in addition to `ctrl+<letter>` and plain single-character keys.

### 🐛 Fixes & cleanup

- Removed the dead `keys.prompt_test` option (it never had a handler). `:config migrate` now also **prunes obsolete keys** from your config file, not only adds new ones.
- Saved-query delete now responds to `d` only (previously `d`/`D`) and is configurable via `keys.saved_query_delete`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-06-13

### 🐛 Fixes — configurable key bindings now actually honor the config

- **Ctrl-combo bindings for `speak` / `auto_refresh` now fire**: both keys were read from the config but only matched as a plain single character, so a `ctrl+...` binding (e.g. `keys.speak: "ctrl+e"`) was silently accepted yet never triggered. They now route through the Ctrl-combo matcher.
- **Navigation/prompt shortcuts respect reconfiguration**: `fast_up`/`fast_down`/`word_left`/`word_right`, `content_search`/`search_next`/`search_prev`, `next_thread`/`prev_thread`, and the prompt-configurator keys (`prompt_regenerate`/`save_prompt`/`prompt_apply`) were hardwired to their default keys and ignored any custom binding. They now match against the configured value (case-sensitive for plain single-character keys).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-13

### 🚀 Features

- **Text-to-speech (read aloud)**: an opt-in, context-aware key reads the focused panel — the message reader, an AI summary, or an Action Plan digest — aloud using a local neural TTS engine ([Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)); press it again to stop. Configure `tts.piper_path` / `tts.model_path` and bind `keys.speak`. Full setup guide in **[docs/TTS.md](docs/TTS.md)**.
- **Auto-refresh → Slack notification**: with `auto_refresh.notify_slack` enabled, auto-refresh also posts a Slack message (count + subject/sender) to your default Slack channel when new mail arrives.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-13

### 🚀 Features — smarter Action Plan analyzer

- **Interests / relevance**: saved analyzer rules are now treated as **interests** too. Write things like "I'm interested in AI" via `:plan rules` (or `Ctrl+R`); the analyzer surfaces matching emails (priority "high" + a note in the category description) instead of burying them in a bulk action. The rules UI is relabeled "rules & interests" for discoverability.
- **Prefers your existing labels**: the analyzer is now given your existing user labels and prefers an exact match for the `label` action, only inventing a new label when none fits — so it stops recommending labels you don't have.
- **`summarize` action (AI digest)**: the analyzer can mark a category as `summarize`; press your summarize key (`y`) on it to get a single combined AI digest of its emails in an in-place panel (Markdown, `Esc` to return) — for mail you'd rather skim than read fully or discard.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`:plan rules` now takes focus**: opening the analyzer-rules picker via `:plan rules` left focus on the message list; it now correctly focuses the picker.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-13

### 🚀 Features

- **Per-item progress for bulk operations**: bulk archive / trash / mark-read / mark-unread / label now show live progress in the status bar ("Archiving 3/10…"), for both the inbox bulk selection and Action Plan group dispatch — no more "looks hung" on large selections.
- **Config self-migration**: new options added in newer releases can be pulled into your existing `config.json` with `:config migrate` (or `giztui --migrate-config`), which adds any missing default keys while preserving your values and `_comment` annotations (writing a `.bak` backup first). The app also notifies on startup when new options are available. Your config keeps working regardless; this just makes new options visible and editable on machines with an older config file.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **"Fetching email bodies…" no longer lingers**: the Action Plan analyzer's body-fetch progress message was persistent and never cleared; it now clears once the fetch completes.
- **`:arr <duration>` now enables auto-refresh**: previously `:autorefresh 1m` only set the interval and silently stayed off if it wasn't already running. It now enables and starts auto-refresh in one step.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-12

### 🚀 Features

- **Opt-in inbox auto-refresh**: a configurable background poll detects new inbox mail. While you are on the plain inbox with nothing open (no picker, search, bulk selection, or composer), new mail is **prepended in place** without disturbing your cursor or view; otherwise a `📬 N` pending counter appears in the status bar (load it with `R`). The status bar shows `⟳` while enabled. Configure via `auto_refresh.enabled` / `auto_refresh.interval` (default off / `5m`, 1-minute minimum); toggle at runtime with `:autorefresh` / `:arr`, set the interval with `:arr 2m`, or bind an optional key via `keys.auto_refresh`. Only the plain inbox is polled (search/folder/thread views idle the ticker).
- **Effective analyzer-prompt viewer (`v`)**: press `v` in the Action Plan to see the exact prompt the analyzer assembles — your saved-rules block plus the base prompt (default or the one opened with `:plan with-prompt`), with `{{messages}}` shown literally and a note on how it is filled per batch. Read-only, in-place; Esc returns to the tree.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Analyzer rules UI no longer hangs**: the `:plan rules` manager was a floating modal that could not be closed (you had to kill the app). It is now an in-place side-panel picker — `a` adds a rule via an embedded input, `d` deletes, Esc closes — matching the other pickers. The `Ctrl+R` quick-remember input in the Action Plan is likewise now an in-place input instead of a floating modal.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### 🚀 Features

- **Richer Action Plan analysis (email body, not just snippet)**: the inbox analyzer now includes each email's plain-text body — truncated, opt-in — in the LLM context in addition to subject/sender, substantially improving classification quality. Controlled by `inbox_analyzer.include_body` (default `true`) and `inbox_analyzer.body_char_limit` (default `1000`). Bodies are fetched concurrently only for the messages actually analyzed (capped at `batch_size × max_batches`), with progress feedback and graceful fallback to the snippet if a body can't be fetched. Set `include_body` to `false` for very large inboxes or slow local models.
- **Bulk-move a whole category in the Action Plan (`m`)**: pressing `m` on a category header — or the "Read manually" group — now moves *all* of that group's emails to a chosen destination at once (another category or a standard action), preserving each email's excluded/checked flag. Pressing `m` on a single email still moves just that one.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-10

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Action plan footer now tracks the cursor**: navigating the tree could leave the bottom hint one keystroke behind (e.g. showing email actions while a category header was highlighted). The footer now repaints in step with the selection.
- **Archiving an all-excluded action plan category no longer hangs**: pressing the archive key on a group with 0 checked emails (footer "(0)") deadlocked the UI; the warning is now shown without blocking.
- **Bulk-style prompts work on a single email**: applying a prompt that uses the `{{messages}}` placeholder to one message via the single-message picker now substitutes the email content (previously the model received no content).
- **Prompt templates show real line breaks**: the built-in prompts stored literal `\n` sequences (visible in the preview); they now contain real newlines, and a migration repairs existing databases.

### 🚀 Features / Improvements

- **Applied-prompt results render Markdown**: prompt results (single and bulk) now go through the same renderer as the email reader, so tables, headings and width-fitting work and raw `| … |`, literal `<br>`, and `??` glyphs are gone.
- **Prompt preview polish**: the preview hides the search field while open, and bolds the **Description** / **Template** headings.
- **Version on the help screen**: the `?` help now shows the GizTUI version at the top.
- **Consistent prompt-type icons**: bulk-analysis prompts now show the 🚀 icon in the single-message picker too (matching the bulk picker).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### 🚀 Features

- **Inbox Action Plan rework (`P` / `:action-plan`)**: the AI triage panel was substantially reworked for trust and control.
  - **Selection-scoped analysis**: analyzes your current bulk selection if you have one, otherwise falls back to the unread inbox. The title shows the scope (e.g. "5 selected" vs "23 unread (inbox)").
  - **Expandable categories with per-email control**: categories are now a navigable tree — `Enter`/`→` expands a group to reveal the actual emails, `←` collapses. Press `Space` to exclude an individual email (`☑`/`☐`); actions act on checked-only. Messages the model declined to categorize appear under a "read manually" group so nothing you selected silently disappears.
  - **Move / recategorize (`m`)**: on an email, press `m` to reassign it to another destination (standard actions or an existing category). The move is recorded in the plan and applied when you dispatch that group.
  - **Non-blocking analysis**: while analysis runs you can `Tab` to the inbox to read mail; `Tab` returns to the panel. The panel keeps analyzing in the background, and `Esc` closes it only when it is focused.
  - **Preference learning**: press `Ctrl+R` to save a free-text, natural-language rule (e.g. "always keep emails from my manager") that the analyzer applies on future runs; manage saved rules with `:action-plan rules`. Rules are interpreted by the LLM (not literal matching) and stored per account.
- **In-place picker panels**: the prompt preview and the action-plan move chooser now open *inside* their panel as deeper navigation instead of as floating modals — consistent, and they no longer get stuck.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Prompt preview was unclosable** (`p` → `Ctrl+P`): the floating preview could not be dismissed (neither `Esc` nor `Ctrl+P`) and required killing the app. It is now an in-place panel that closes reliably; `Enter` applies the highlighted prompt, `Esc`/`Ctrl+P` returns to the list. Same treatment in the bulk prompt picker.
- **Action plan "move" hung the app**: selecting a destination froze the UI (a deadlock from calling a status update synchronously on the UI thread). The status message is now dispatched off-thread.
- **Action plan footer showed the wrong context**: navigating the tree could show "email" actions while a category header was highlighted (and vice versa), because a programmatic cursor move did not refresh the selection state. The footer now always reflects the highlighted node.
- **Action plan focus/navigation after analysis**: replacing the scroll-only view with a tree fixes the lost focus and broken `↑`/`↓` navigation after a streamed analysis completed; the panel border is also highlighted when focused.
- **Email rendering**: repaired malformed 256-color palette tags (e.g. `[#0099ff-::b]`) that leaked as literal text into the reader for some Markdown headings.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- New `AnalyzerRulesService` + `analyzer_rules` table (DB migration v8, account-scoped) feeding user preference rules into the analyzer prompt via `InboxAnalyzerOptions.UserRules`; accessed through a dedicated `GetAnalyzerRulesService()` getter.
- Action plan panel rebuilt on `tview.TreeView`; selection derived from the current node (`syncSelectionToNode`) as the single source of truth; context-aware footer.
- Shared `showPromptPreviewInline` helper for the single and bulk prompt pickers; in-place body-swap pattern with a `currentFocus` pass-through in the global key router so focused in-panel widgets own their keys.
- Spec and implementation plans for the rework and the in-place panels under `docs/superpowers/`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### 🚀 Features

- **Prompt preview (Ctrl+P)**: in the prompt picker (single message or bulk), press `Ctrl+P` with a prompt highlighted to open a popup showing its description and full template, so you can confirm what a prompt does before applying it. Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+P` again to close and return to the picker. Works whether focus is on the search field or the list.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Prompt picker applied the wrong prompt**: pressing Enter from the search field applied the first prompt regardless of what was highlighted (and the "✨ Create new with AI…" entry could never be chosen that way). Enter now acts on the highlighted item, and the highlight follows the first match while filtering. Fixed in both the single and bulk pickers.
- **Focus lost after bulk actions**: after a bulk archive, trash, mark-read/unread, Obsidian, or Slack operation, neither pane showed the active highlight until you pressed `Tab`. Focus and the focus-indicator border now return to the message list automatically.
- **Email rendering (Markdown)**:
  - Removed non-homogeneous background bars caused by glamour styling code blocks, rules and tables with their own backgrounds that clashed with the reader pane theme.
  - Eliminated the `??`/`�` glyphs in rendered tables and rules: box-drawing characters (East-Asian-Width "Ambiguous", which tcell could render double-width and clip) are now mapped to ASCII so lines fit the pane.
  - Made link URLs readable — dropped glamour's black foreground that was effectively invisible on the dark reader pane (links keep their underline).
- **In-app help (`?`) was out of date**: corrected the `M` shortcut description (it toggles Markdown rendering, it does not "export"), and documented the AI touch-up toggle (`:touch-up`), the account picker (`Ctrl+A` / `:accounts`), and the inbox Action Plan (`P` / `:action-plan`).

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Added a shared `focusList()` helper centralizing focus + indicator restoration, and a `promptPickerSelection()` helper shared by the picker Enter handling and the new preview.
- Render pipeline post-processing (`stripTagBackgrounds`, `asciiBoxDrawing`, `fixLinkContrast`) applied to glamour output before display, each covered by unit tests.
- Added design specs and implementation plans for the prompt preview (shipped here) and the upcoming auto-refresh inbox toggle under `docs/superpowers/`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-08

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Markdown rendering polish** (follow-ups to v1.4.0):
  - Collapse intra-line duplicate call-to-action links (e.g. `Pide un Glovo [1] Pide un Glovo [1]` → `Pide un Glovo [1]`), which occurred when a newsletter rendered the same CTA as both a button image and a text link.
  - Drop orphaned emoji skin-tone modifiers (U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF) that previously survived as tofu after their base emoji was stripped.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Extracted a shared `rerenderCurrentMessage` helper behind the `M` (markdown) and `:touch-up` toggles, removing duplicated re-render/fetch logic.
- Bounded the rendered-body cache to 256 entries with single-entry eviction to keep long-session memory in check.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### ✨ Features

- **Markdown email rendering**: HTML emails now render as clean, Markdown-styled text **by default**, making newsletters and marketing emails far more readable in the terminal. Press `M` (or `:markdown` / `:md`) to toggle between the Markdown view and the original raw/plain view, per message.
  - A cleanup pipeline removes the noise that makes HTML emails unreadable: tracking-pixel images, empty layout tables, and zero-width spacer characters are stripped, and long tracking URLs are collected into a `Links` section at the bottom instead of cluttering the body.
  - Conversion is **pure-Go and in-process** (`html-to-markdown` v2), styled with `glamour` — no external runtime dependency. A proof-of-concept bake-off against Microsoft's markitdown found markitdown produced empty layout tables and charset corruption on real newsletters, so the pure-Go path was chosen.
  - New `rendering` config block: `markdown_default` (default `true`), `glamour_theme` (`dark`/`light`/`notty`/`auto`), and `drop_tracking_images` (default `true`).
  - The previous LLM whitespace touch-up (formerly on `M`) moved to the new `:touch-up` command.
  - Falls back gracefully to the existing plain-text renderer on any conversion error or for plain-text-only emails.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- New service-first rendering pipeline in `internal/render/markdown_render.go`; render-mode state managed by `DisplayService`; rendered output cached per message/mode/width.
- Fixed a pre-existing data race on the LLM touch-up flag (`llmTouchUpEnabled` is now an `atomic.Bool`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-07

### ✨ Features

- **Inbox Action Plan**: A new AI-assisted triage panel, opened with `P` (capital P) or `:action-plan` (aliases `:plan`, `:ap`). It groups the **unread** messages already loaded in the current view into a few actionable categories (archive, mark-as-read, trash, label) and lets you dispatch each group with a single keystroke. Categories stream in progressively as each batch is analyzed; press `Esc` to cancel at any time (work done so far stays on screen). Per category, two escape hatches: `:` opens the command palette scoped to that category's messages (virtual bulk selection), and `p` opens the bulk prompt picker scoped to the same set. Override the built-in analyzer with any saved prompt via `:action-plan with-prompt <name-or-id>`.
  - Runs in **fast mode**: it uses only the subject, sender, and snippet already in memory, so it makes **no extra Gmail API calls**.
  - Degrades gracefully when the LLM returns malformed or empty output — one stricter repair retry, then any uncategorized messages fall back to a "Read manually" bucket so nothing is lost.
  - New service-first `InboxAnalyzerService` (configurable batching, JSON parsing with out-of-range guarding, cross-category de-duplication, and category merging across batches; calls the AI service directly).
  - New `inbox_analyzer` configuration block (`batch_size` default 50, `max_batches` default 10) and a configurable `keys.action_plan` shortcut (default `P`). See `docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md`.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- The analyzer's default `batch_size` of 50 is tuned for capable cloud models. Small local models (e.g. a 7B Ollama model) can struggle to follow the JSON schema across 50 messages and may return no categories — lower `inbox_analyzer.batch_size` to 15–20 in that case (documented in `docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` and `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`).
- Background analysis renders are marshalled onto the UI thread via `QueueUpdateDraw` for reliable progressive painting, the panel's keys are routed past the global shortcut handler (so quick-actions and escape hatches work from the panel's text view), and the streaming-cancel lifecycle is guarded against close/reopen races.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-03

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Help screen panic on `?` (#6)**: Fixed nil pointer dereference in `generateHelpText` when `config.json` had no `obsidian` section (i.e. fresh installs running on `DefaultConfig`). The four call-sites that dereferenced `Config.Obsidian.Enabled` now go through a defensive `IsObsidianEnabled()` helper, and the helper is covered by table-driven tests including the default-config case that reproduced the crash.
- **Bulk-select checkbox refresh**: Pressing `*` in bulk mode now updates the ☑/☐ glyph on every row immediately, even when the optional message-numbers column is enabled. Replaced the hardcoded "flags is column 0" assumption in `updateBulkSelectionStyling` with a per-row scan that finds the checkbox glyph regardless of layout. Also removed the defensive prepend branch that was contaminating the numbers column with a stray glyph on first use.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **Lint debt cleanup**: `make pre-commit-check` now passes with 0 issues. Annotated 9 intentional gosec findings with justified `// #nosec` markers (G304 on validated DB paths, G204 on hardcoded per-OS open binaries, G117 on intentional OAuth token persistence, G101 on test fixture paths) and refactored 30+ `strings.Builder.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))` call-sites to the more efficient `fmt.Fprintf(&builder, ...)` form (staticcheck QF1012).
- **Developer docs**: Refreshed `AGENTS.md` with the current 12-value `GetServices()` signature, the canonical pre-commit verification command, a project layout overview, and the precise `make test` scope.

## [1.2.3] - 2025-09-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Message Deletion**: Fix stale message content after deleting an item. When pressing `d`, the selection stays in place and the content panel now shows the new selected message. Added selection-change guard in `showMessage`/`showMessageWithoutFocus` and avoided updating `currentMessageID` on preview.
- **Deletion/Selection Races**: Additional safeguards to reduce race conditions when removing rows and re-selecting the next message in the list.
- **Command Parsing**: Proper quoted-string handling for `:command` arguments to avoid split errors.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **Race-condition Guard**: Validate current selection before painting content when background loading completes, preventing outdated renders.
- **CI Reliability**: Improve GitHub Actions cache configuration to reduce cache-restore failures.
