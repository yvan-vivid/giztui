- [x] When I perform a local search with /term and press Enter, focus moves to the message list but its border is not highlighted. Also, I cannot return to the search widget using Tab. We could either 1) include it in the tab order to allow refining the search, or 2) close the widget immediately after launching the search and open a new one if needed.
- [x] Welcome screen doesn't pool the shortcuts from the customization.
- [x] When I'm in a panel other than Labels (e.g., "Drafts") and I maximize the screen, after repaint it shows the Labels panel instead of Drafts. This also happens when the initial 50 messages are loaded and i before they finished loading i open the drafts pickers, when the 50 messages finished loading the labels picker is opened (as if i have pressed the l)

- [x] **Lint debt cleanup** - `make pre-commit-check` now passes with 0 issues. Annotated 9 gosec findings with justified `// #nosec` markers (G304 on validated DB paths, G204 on hardcoded per-OS open binaries, G117 on intentional OAuth token persistence, G101 on test fixture paths) and refactored 13+ `WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))` call-sites to `fmt.Fprintf(&builder, ...)` (commits `df8db83`, `873c35a`)
- [x] **GitHub Actions modernised to Node.js 24** - bumped checkout/setup-go/cache/upload-artifact/dependency-review/github-script/codecov/codeql/gh-release to current major versions; pinned `aquasecurity/trivy-action` from `@master` to `@v0.36.0` (commit `07fde36`)

- [x] **`.claude/` infrastructure committed** - added `cve-security-analyzer` agent and `release` slash command from a previously-unsynced work machine, with minor adjustments (`KillShell` → `KillBash` for consistency; `make test/lint/vet` → `make pre-commit-check`)
- [x] **TODO.md backlog migrated to GitHub Issues** - the active backlog (35 issues, #7-41) now lives in https://github.com/ajramos/giztui/issues with `area:*` and `priority:*` labels; vague/duplicate items dropped during triage; items already covered by code recognised as zombi and moved here
